I have two notes:
- Install Application Launcher in Node Manager Server:
1.Open a web browser and enter the northbound IP address of OMS.
 -  the IP need to be added in the trusted site of Node Manager Server browser  -
    Otherwise this step will not be work

- Install BTS Site Manager in Node Manager Server 
2. Run the BTSSiteEM-build version of BTS Site Manager.exe file. For example, BTSSiteEM-LTE50-1234_123_12.exe.
And from where the customer should dive those BTSSiteEM_version.exe?  - is it some open source or does this xx.exe file come with NSN delivery -- Please, specify!

Describe the problem and what led up to the issue being observed:(Steps performed) 
We triggered LNCEL Reset from Monitor and it was not completed after a hour also.
After that none of the operation (lock, unlock, shutdown) was triggering properly.
And getting the error message as 'Error message 'Existing operation is still running, please try again later.' appears' after the above operation.

2. Exact Steps to reproduce the problem (if the issue can be reproduced): 
Triggered LNCEL lock & unlock from Monitor.
And trigger LNCEL reset from Monitor.

3. Expected Results: 
Monitor should process the request to State management and to CM Operation Manager.
Operation Manager should provision a plan file to reset the LNCEL.
LNCEL should be Reset.

4. Actual Results: 
Acutal Operation was not completed after more than 20 mins.
and State management was not able delete the .LCK file in Netact.

Please see attachment. There is a picture from NSM tool where you can see that after cm upload was started, vm22/vm23 is trying to use several different ports. In current document there is this configured to vm9 (nwi3). And in later tries, you could see also vm20 trying use these ports. They are WAS hosts. Should the firewall rules be changed from table 2 (rows 1 & 4) to use virtual addresses of WAS instead of NWI3?","NAR8/CUDODOCS_N8 8.0.3.1014, NAR8/CUDODOCS 8.0.0.972","NETACT 8"

PE transfered to NN6ADAP04 since it seams that partition mgmt works in principle, but usage by adaption has a bug:
     On the  12th of Feb I run the following command (among others):

pmpmgrmx.pl -a NOKLTE_PMC -s -t 8

The log seemed to run fine, without any errors. But it handled only one table (attached log).
--------------------------------------------------------------

After upgrade from Netact8 EP1 P8 to MP4 the management of PM partitions is broken for most LTE PM tables. 
 
The same problem  already occured in Netact8 EP2/Netact15 and has reported here.
PR 46388ESPE06: NetAct15 PT3: PM Partition Management Broken

In Scv340 it was noticed that for LTE adapatation the Partition manager did not created new partitions for PM data. The cron jobs were executed on VM30, but PMPMGR did nevertheless not the expected actions.

As result of this fault all new PM data went into the PM_MAXDATA partitions which should be empty in a healthy system. From there the data is NOT removed by dropping the expired partitions. Subsequently, at some time the PM DB operations should slow down, and DB will fill up all available space.

Plase note that the consequences of this problem are not immediately visible to the users of Netact with checking the partitions in PM DB manually. The big risk is that e.g. in customer environment this fault would only detected when PM performance goes down and customer will not necessarily know why this happens. When the DB is full, then of course whole Netact will stop working. For that reason this PR is B class (at least).

The issue was now found by noticing that after several weeks the lab has been up&running DB size grew all the time.

The unit of the counter in the description shows “per radio frame” although it need to be “500ms”. 
This unit change was introduced by PR122997ESPE04 and closed in December 12. RISE was updated at the time.  However, NetAct does not show the update. It need to be updated in NetAct for RL70 also.

We checked on the following load and it is still incorrect.

When trying to evaluate the EPS Bearer Counters it was recognized that many counters are already offered in the Report Creator, which are not implemented in RL60 - M8006C188 to M8006C236.
They can only be found in the RL70 documentation.

As they are not implemented they do not show values.

Additional there is some mismatch between the counters and the table names for four of this counters.
M8006C224, M8006C225, M8006C235, M8006C236. This leads to a SQL exception and makes it impossible to evaluate the remaining counters until this counters are removed from the selection. As it is possibly quite normal to display all available counters for one group (here: M8006) this leads to handling problems.

The RL70 counters should be removed to prevent problems.

python /opt/oss/NSN-nwi3/bin/mrAssociation.zip -a FQDN 

The problem with this tool is that it only associates 2 top level objects for LTE.
Namely it will associate MRBTS and LNBTS objects to the MR of the agent (iOMS).
This is a wrong approach.
This breaks at least 2 things:
1) Alarms are coming from eNBs with inconsistent MR. So alarms that are originated from MRBTS and/or LNBTS will have MR associated, but alarms originated from LNCELL or FTM (and children) will come with no MR. This breaks very usefull functionality of beeing able to right click on MR and select Find in - Alarm List.
2) Many children objects simply won't have any MR. This causes problems with CM tools and permissions.
Let's say if one of my iOMS (agent) with all it's children (eNBs) is assigned to one MR and another iOMS is assigned to another MR. And I want to give certain group of people access to CM to one MR and block to another MR - this won't work. As many of the objects will simply have no MR.

Eitrher :
1) This MR Association tool needs to be fixed
or
2) References to it should be removed from the documentation

There are 2 other ways to assign object and children to MR

When checking the performance data in NetAct 15 I found strange entries related to ""WBTS-0"" with ""Cell-0"". One for each RNC.

We do not have such a WBTS configured.

Also the PM data on OMS shows this data so it seems to be a network problem.

However from Nokia NE support I got the answer: no we do not have such cell configured.

Where does this data come from?

We have noticed an issue when using WBTS Site Manager to do a recommission of an HSPA NodeB. In WBTS Site Manager you can do a commissioning to change/update parameters and then do a Send Parameters at the very end to have those changes take effect. WBTS Site Manager fails the portion of Sending Parameters with error message. It seems to affect certain subnet addresses as we have seen some BTS ip addresses that work. This issue happens whether BTS Site Manager is launched from Node Manager or from within monitor application. In comparison, if I take a NodeB which fails the Sending Parameters via BTS Site Manager launched from within NM, that same NodeB will work if I connect to it via BTS Site Manager launched under NetAct 5. It turned out there are several ports which are blocked by firewall from BTS to NM: 13062-13069. This can be only found in OSS5 firewall documentation, but not in 15.5. Please update documentation for all firewall rules for WBTS, I-HSPA, etc. like it was in OSS5.","CuDo collector NAR8/CUDODOCS_n15-5/15.5.0.2230, NetAct 15.5.0.980, CuDo collector NA16_ADAP_COLLECTOR/16.0.0.368, NetAct netact/product/99.15.05.0.6386","NetAct 15.5 pilot"

We had an outage yesterday 19.5 - 20.5 in NetAct NWI3 (navm9) interface/adaptation.
This basically means that no nothing worked in 3G + LTE + FEMTO (FM, PM, CM) -> Very fatal and critical problem.

I don't know for sure when this problem started because NWI3 error logs were overwritten quickly.
But I fixed this at 20.5 ~ 01:18am by restarting all services under navm9 (stop/start node navm9) -> Steps in attachment.

What I can see in the logs is that error log was writing heavily this message:
| navm9 |  | ServerMessageReceptor1165[49152/10.130.16.171:58005] [1432073120237] | WARN  | jacorb.poa.queue | Request queue is full, consider increasing jacorb.poa.queue_max (currently: 100)

-> All NWI3 logs from that moment are in attached zip-file.

There was no any NetAct internal alarms in that moment -> which I think is a clear fault itself which needs to be fixed.

Our iOMS/OMS were sending alarms that NetAct connection/registration is broken. But problem was clearly in NetAct side since all iOMS/OMS servers sending a same alarm.

Could you please investigate what went wrong to avoid this to happen in the future?

I heard that RAN engineer was using heavily SW Manager application where he tried to download+activation SW to ~500 WBTSes at the same time and application hanged and this might be a one possible cause to get NWI3 broken. But of course any user action should not cause this kind of outage. There should be limits in every applications etc.

If this will happen again we need to raise ticket priority to Major.

Thanks,

I have a few follow-up questions on this RCA.

1.	Would we still have some limit in 15.5 (e.g. 2000 MRBTS at a time)? If yes, what is the number?
2.	What overload protection is implemented in 15.5 to avoid reaching this situation?
3.	Why nwi3 wasn’t able to recover from this situation automatically and it had to be restarted manually?

Last week, we have upgraded the NetAct from 15.2 to 15.5.

Then I found hourly Quality KPI(LTE_5441B, LTE_5444B, LTE_5444B, LTE_5541B, LTE_5544B, LTE_1073A) issues.

That KPIs are sometimes missing.

For example, 12:00 to 23:00 time quality KPIs will can see.

But, 00:00 to 08:00 time quality KPIs will can't see.

Due to this KPI it can also affect other reports(RSLTE029, RSLTE023, RSLTE024, RSLTE025).

Could you check this issues?

Thank you so much.

Measurements under this C3SOMS09 are coming to OSS but not all files are getting transferred/fetched.
I investigated this alarm yesterday and noticed that there's OLD xml files under ../xmlfiles and that could be the reason why this alarm was triggered.
There's a script that runs every night in the OSS to manually fetch OLD files. 
When I checked this morning, those old files were gone (so this is good and expected!).
Now, a new alarm came again. I checked again and found new OLD xml files for today - that's why this alarm is triggered again.

We need to find out what's causing some files not getting fetch on time?
What is the defined threshold and where to check (OMS or OSS) ?

I have opened this case towards OSS 1st. IF needed, please reassign to OMS Team.

Here's the logs for today:
Noticed that these files are old, time is at 10:55 but we're seeing files from Aug 20 and 21 early this morning.

this case is open after the investigation of case ""NA05848771 / / ACCEPTACE CASE Netact15.5MP1 - Mismatch between Monitor and Software Manager release value"", which Mazur Marcin considered to be better focused in the real issue described below.


After MRBTS upgrade to FL15A from BTS Site Manager the release field on Monitor is not what we expect, (LNZ5.0 instead FL15A).

If an upload from CM is done nothings changes but after a send to network operation on the MRBTS from CM Editor, for example changing the name, the release filed  updates to the correct value.

The NE version field on Monitor is correct (FL15A).

In attach you can find screenshoot before and after ""send to network"" event.

Please take this as really important being the issue arisen during acceptance tests of release, which took place two months ago.

Additional statement :

In my opinion this should be added to documentation as customers have problems after upgrade with this.

Now only what I have found in documentation it is :

In the Single RAN LTE modeling there are two additional sets of LTE hierarchies in Performance Manager. Hierarchy set PLMN/SBTS is used for reporting of PM data only coming from Single RAN LTE and hierarchy set PLMN/VLOFLNBTSPARENT is used for reporting of PM data for both Single RAN LTE and legacy LTE.

But this is in chapter System Overviews > Single RAN Management Overview not in LTE related chapters.
This should be explained in some LTE chapters","ua_n16-2p8/T2-module-ohc 16.2.100.1980, ua/T2-module-ohc 99.15.0.1933","NetAct 16.2 pilot"

Test Scenario Steps]
Test of CUAA function:
I activated CUAA in NetAct application NEAC for OMS with mode Prefer_TLS.
This terminates successful, CNUM status is Activated.
Then I try to deactivate CUAA for this OMS in the same way (with Deactivate button)

[2. Fault Description]
I get result: ""Failed deactivation""

[3. Tester Analysis]
The same behavior is, when I apply it for BTS.
Seems that CUAA is deactivated for the NE.
I use NetAct CloudLab 667 with load NetAct15.5

[4. Fault Repeatability]
 How many times Test Scenario was run? 5
 How many times fault was reproduced? 5
 Were there any noticeable differences in Test Scenario run in cases fault was reproducible and not reproducible?

Problem found on BELK and in the latest NeVe lab installed with build 693. There is one port missing from official integration document. As verified with firewall personnel (configuring firewalls for NeVe labs), when 13062 port is missing from rules described in integration document, it's not possible to reconfigure eNB's configuration with site manager, when it's installed and launched directly from NetAct node manager.

Test scenario- open remote desktop to node manager, open site manager, connect eNB, go to 'Commissioning' panel and choose 'Reconfiguration', perform changes that would be sent as file to eNB i.e. configure alarm numbers for triggering symptom data collection (LTE1099 Symptom Data Collection).

Observations:
- after applying all firewall rules basing on integration document- commissioning fails (sending parameters from node manager to eNB fails),
- disabling all rules and allowing all traffic without any rules- commissioning is successful,
- enabling all traffic basing on all previously created rules (step 1) and creating additional undefined rule for port 13062- commissioning is successful.

Logs and screenshots attached. Severity has been selected basing on impacted functionality.

I attached also whole discussion with firewall expert. Initially we tried to add a rule with port 80 to make functionality work, but it wasn't right lead. As checked further in BTS site manager's log file, it turned out that 13062 is taken into use.","integrating_flexi_multiradio_bts_lte_to_netact  /NAR8/CUDODOCS_n15-5/15.5.0.2186, integrating_flexi_multiradio_bts_lte_to_netact /NAR8/CUDODOCS/99.15.0.2168","NetAct 15.5"

	From installation stack, it is visible that ‘nwi3med’ is added into UserRepo.xml of node19 only. 

	Since the user is not listed in UserRepo.xml of other nodes, it is not able to change password of ‘nwi3med’ from any other WAS nodes. 
	This is an issue if node19 goes down or WAS service is stopped in node19. And as per CuDo we should be able to change password of ‘nwi3med’ from any WAS node.

[3. Tester Analysis] 
	During DCA installation, 'nwi3med' user is added using the attribute name: attribute attrName=""OSS.CROLE.DB_CONFIG_ACCESS"" /, which is mapped only to one WAS node. That is the reason why the user in installed only in one node. During any upgrade, password-tool, replicates the users among all WAS nodes & thus 'nwi3med' is available in all WAS nodes after any upgrade.

However this kind of check should not be required in WCDMA SFS and the checking should be removed from SW  upload.

WCDMA Network SFS contains this kind of requirement:

OM_GEN_SFS_NetSec.817

Identity verification

Network elements shall not verify peer identities when setting up TLS and SSH2 connections.
Rationale:
This is to avoid failed connections, resulting e.g. from network renumbering. From the security standpoint, the RSA authentication that verifies that the peer posseses the private key corresponding to the public key signed by the trusted CA is sufficient, i.g. the authentication procedure is verifying that the peer is a trusted peer - and it is not too relevant what specific peer it is.

WCDMA Note: Valid for UltraBTS and AXC later than for the FlexiBTS (see RAN1718)

*** 9.1 Integration data upload failure ***
Step 5 implies operator to manually set NWI3 registration IOR to OMS parameter tool., the operation is now illegal in NetAct. IOR shall not be manually filled in any case but has to be automatically handled by NWI3 protocol.
The whole step 5 can be removed.
In step 2, there is no IDU trigger after NWI3-1 object re-created, it makes no sense to re-create NWI3 object without doing anything with it.

2.
*** 9.2 CM upload or provision failure ***
The subject is indicating two scenarios: CM upload failure and CM provision failure.
Actually we don't perform CM provision in this document then why it's mentioned here?
Moreover, CM provision operation requires additional step to add DNS entry (of NetAcT LB-WAS hostname : LB-WAS virtual IP)  on OMS DNS server before CM provision/download. It's not part of Integration Document. Without the configuration CM provision will definitely fail.
Checked other documents, such as RNC, FZC, MGW and FNG, the title is all unified as ""Configuration Management upload failure"". Why LTE is so different?
Please remove the term of provision or use unified subject.

*** 2.1 Prerequisites for LTE iOMS ***

In this table we provide instructions to modify OMS system id. This shall not be mentioned in integration document.
To perform integration we are assuming the element is correctly installed and configured according to customer's environment and network planning. Integration shall start if some basis items are with problem and the document shall not provide instruction to correct them neither.
Current content may cause confusion so please delete the content of indicating operator to modify OMS System ID. We shall only fetch it without touching it.","ossmw/T2-module-ohc 16.0.10.2907, ossmw/T2-module-ohc 16.0.10.2907, NAR8/CUDODOCS_n15-5 15.5.0.2293","NetAct 16"

The LTE16 NE has been integrated to NetAct16.2 successfully.
The MRBTS-XXX object has been enabled CNUM successfully via NetAct omc user account.
The LNBTS-XXX object doesn’t  been enabled the CNUM.

Steps:
1.	Login to NetAct monitor via omc account and focus on the LTE16 NE object.
2.	Right click the MRBTS object, select menu Element Management    Element Management(Read Only), check the permission control of EM launcher of BTSSM.
3.	Right click the LNBTS object, select menu Element Management    Element Management(Read Only), check the permission control of EM launcher of BTSSM.

Expected Result:
2.    The login account omc (NetAct user/remote user) should login to BTSSM via EM launch successfully, and it should have Read Only permission for operating the BTSSM.
3.    The login account Nemuadmin (NE local user) should login to BTSSM via EM launch successfully, and it should have Read Only permission for operating the BTSSM.

Actual Result:
2.    The login account omc (NetAct user/remote user) can login to BTSSM via EM launch successfully, but it has Read-Write permission for operating the BTSSM.
3.    The login account Nemuadmin (NE local user) can login to BTSSM via EM launch successfully, but it has Read-Write permission for operating the BTSSM.
So, user cannot operate the BTSSM with Read Only permission according to the NetAct EM launch menu operation.

Stopping the nx2s service
Stopping a service is not at all recommended unless there is a critical configuration change that requires restart.
1.     Log in to the service VM, and switch to the root user.
To locate the service VM, see Locating the right virtual machine for a service.
2.     To stop the service, enter:
[root]# smanager.pl stop service n2xs

Test Scenario Steps]
1. Start-up - OK
2. Cell Setup - OK
3. trigger e.g. fault 2007  - OK
4. check alarm details in Monitor for 2007 – OK
5. failure in optical RP3 interface can be seen in the details – NOK

 [2. Fault Description]

At step 5: 
Expected behavior is:
Failure in optical interface
Observed behavior is:
failure in optical RP3 interface

[3. Tester Analysis]

According CRL8558 the fault name is changed to failure in optical interface.

RISE is not updated. RISE changes related to the CRL8558 for the faults are correct but not for the alarms.
For me it is not clear who takes care for the alarms in RISE. Therefore I have written the Pronto to NetAct. Sorry if this is the wrong way! But I have no contact person for problems like this!

4. Detail Test Steps

1. Prepare and commision BTS and integrate to NetAct


2. Open NetAct Operating Instructions for certificate Managementin http://belk.netact.noklab.net/

3. Start to follow documented procedures according to the documentation and process for certificate handling fails in:

---------
Steps in link:
http://belk.netact.noklab.net:8080/N16/topic/integrating_sbts_to_netact/preparation/configuring_certificate_sbts.html?cp=3_87_2_1 13:45 
http://belk.netact.noklab.net:8080/N16/topic/administering_netact_system_security_base/concepts/managing_certificates.html?cp=8_1_0_1 

----------

5. Expected Result
Documentation should be similar to:

https://confluence.int.net.nokia.com/display/BLRMW/How+to+install+certificate+on+NetAct+and+SBTS

------ extract ------
Go to start of metadata 


Certificate server:
http://10.41.100.254:8080

1. Configure DN for sbts
     NE: SBTS-15: 10.58.251.225     dn: sbts15.mbbcemoss.org

2. On NetAct dmgr node:
cp /opt/oss/NSN-sm_conf_cert/templates/smcert.properties.template /opt/oss/NSN-sm_conf_cert/templates/smcert.properties
/opt/oss/NSN-sm_conf_cert/bin/smcert_gen_server_csr.sh
cd /opt/oss/NSN-sm_conf_cert/generated/server/
9 files are generated. 3 of them will be used: 
NetAct_j2eeLb.csr
NetAct_ldap.csr   
NetAct_medLb.csr


3. Install certificate to NetAct
Go to http://10.41.100.254:8080
a.     Choose one CA as rootCA from CA list, here we choose MBBTampereRootCA. And copy the certificate content to 
        /var/opt/oss/global/certs/rootCA/NetAct_rootCert.pem
        /var/opt/oss/global/certs/rootCA/NetAct_L0_CACert.pem 
          And also get one copy on local as CA.pem
b.     From the certificate server, click PKCS FROM Enrollment link, and sign the 3 files which are generated in step 2
        Copy the content in the file to web site, and choose certification Authority as MBBTampereRootCA, and then submit the request.
        Copy the encoded certificate to following corresponding location:
          NetAct_j2eeLb.csr   =  encoded   =  /var/opt/oss/global/certs/server/NetAct_j2eeLbCert.pem
          NetAct_ldap.csr  =  encoded  =  /var/opt/oss/global/certs/server/NetAct_ldapCert.pem
          NetAct_medLb.csr  =  encoded  =  /var/opt/oss/global/certs/server/NetAct_medLbCert.pem
c.     /opt/oss/NSN-sm_conf_cert/bin/smcert_apply_cert.sh
     This command will install the certificate to NetAct, and in the procedure, some node will be restarted include was node. It may cost 30 mins to finish.
     result:
     smcert  ### Installing Certificate-Revocation-List (CRL) completed successfully###
     smcert  #### Applying certificate configuration completed successfully ####

4.  Install certificate to SBTS
Check 

Still in /opt/oss/NSN-sm_conf_cert/generated/server/
a.     /opt/oss/NSN-sm_conf_cert/bin/smcert_gen_csr.sh --cn sbts15.mbbcemoss.org --dns sbts15.mbbcemoss.org --systemName sbts15system --certId sbts15
          systemName and certId can define by yourself
          cn and dns should be the same and equal dn configured in step 1
          3 files are generated, 2 of them will be used:
          sbts15system_sbts15.csr
          sbts15system_sbts15Key.pem
b.          vi /opt/oss/NSN-sm_conf_cert/templates/serverKey.pwd
               Copy the password
          openssl pkcs8 -in sbts15system_sbts15Key.pem -out sbts15system_sbts15KeyRSA.pem
               paste the password
          Save the generated file sbts15system_sbts15KeyRSA.pem to loal as privateKey.pem
c.     Use MBBTampereRootCA as rootCA to sign sbts15system_sbts15.csr, and save to local as EEcert.pem
          Currently on SBTS version SBTS16_ENB_A50_0000_000195_000000, got a pronto, need to add one empty line at the end of EEcert.pem  The pronto was fixed, the SBTS version: SBTS16_ENB_A50_0000_000213_000000
d.     Check TLS mode on SBTS:
http://belk.netact.noklab.net:8080/N16/topic/integrating_sbts_to_netact/preparation/checking_tls_on_sbts.html?cp=3_86_2_0
         
e.     On sbts web UI Certificates table. Deploy the 3 files follow      http://belk.netact.noklab.net:8080/N16/topic/integrating_sbts_to_netact/preparation/configuring_certificate_sbts.html?cp=3_86_2_1
          EEcert.pem
          privateKey.pem
          CA.pem          -- from step 3.a

5.     Verifying NetAct connectivity towards SBTS by using the root CA certificate
http://belk.netact.noklab.net:8080/N16/topic/integrating_sbts_to_netact/preparation/verifying_netact_connectivity_root_certificate.html?cp=3_86_3_6
          openssl s_client -tls1 -connect sbts15.mbbcemoss.org:8443 -CAfile /var/opt/oss/global/certs/rootCA/NetAct_rootCert.pem
          result:
          SSL-Session:
    Protocol  : TLSv1
    Cipher    : AES256-SHA
    Session-ID: 70230E28E84E5767AE557883E81236C9639931FAFF003831E6B5C6D294DF5CFB
    Session-ID-ctx:
    Master-Key: 8373F4072F7081DA8F103BBD74832D63D62F8A4EBB1475E0E1F26ECF9F6B86880F3C2FE278D4A958591DADA51BB8E956
    Key-Arg   : None
    Krb5 Principal: None
    PSK identity: None
    PSK identity hint: None
    Start Time: 1440647233
    Timeout   : 7200 (sec)
    Verify return code: 0 (ok)

Now you can start to integration with TLS mode.

-----------------


6. Actual Result
Some steps are missing for sbts specifically in documentation


7. Fault Occurrence Rate (exact number of attempts and fault occurrences, e.g. 2/7)
Problem is tested and found to be constant in SBTS16.2_ENB_A53_9999_000019_000000

8. Change since Last Success (what was changed since it was tested successfully for the last time)
N/A

9. Known Condition (Description of the fault’s trigger)
Following Certificate installation procedures

10. Log(s) file name containing a fault (clear indication (exact file name) where fault can be found in attached logs)

11. Customer impact analysis
- Without correct customer documentation on certificate handling, customer cannot be expected to install required sbts cerstificates correctly, causing wasted time, effort and possible fails to bts and KPIs.
- Workaround and recovery 
12. Tester analysis (Analysis of Logs, the reason why select the group in ""Group In Charge"" is specified. It is preferred to list the related requirements ID. in this case. Please also mention the last working build if possible)
Incoorect documentation is a serious customer perceived quality issue and should be taken as a priority issue.","< empty >","NetAct 16.2"

After reboot of OMS entry is deleted
The host entry must be inserted that CM provisioning from NetAct is working. See Pronto PR100629. This is an official workaround
Doku see http://belk.netact.noklab.net:8080/N16-2/index.jsp?topic=%2Fintegrating_flexi_multiradio_bts_lte_to_netact%2Fcommon%2Ftasks%2Fadding_lb_was_entry_to_ne_host_file.html





[2. Fault Description]

       DescriptionAverage number of available Channel Elements. In Ultrasite WCDMA BTS counter is the average amount of working baseband resources (HW capacity). In Flexi WCDMA BTS when baseband pooling is not used, counter is the average amount of sum of basic capacity and licensed capacity. In Flexi WCDMA BTS when baseband pooling is in use, counter is the average amount of Local Cell Group dedicated baseband pool CE capacity + total amount of CEs in common baseband pool - CEs used by other Local Cell groups from common baseband pool at the counter sampling moment.
Note: If HW capacity available for LCG is less than licenced capacity then HW capacity is indicated in counter.
Note: This counter is not supported anymore in Rel2 BTS HW with WN7.0 or later SW. The valid R99 CE and HSPA user amount counters in Rel2 BTS HW are provided by M5006 measurement (counters M5006C0...C38).

Test Scenario Steps] 

Look at WireShark trace CM, PM, SWM upload with IPv6 from iOMS to NetAct


[2. Fault Description] 

For PM and SWM (but not for CM) the following (and only with IPv6) is observerd:
NetAct start sending an HTTP get(s) request(s) not including the credentionals for authentification (omsFTPUser1/omsFTPUser2)
the iOMS answers with HTTP ""Authorization Required""
The next time NetAct repeats HTTP-get including the correct credentials and everything work fine
Now the requested file(s) is(are) sent by the iOMS

[3. Tester Analysis] 

The behavior is observerd for PM and SWM, but not for CM upload
In case of CM the HTTP get request send by NetAct requiring the plan file alway includes the credentials

Maybe the reason is that at NetAct different LoadBalancer are used for HTTP in case of CM and PM/SWM
One load balancer works fine and the other is not confiugred correctly

[4. Fault Repeatability] 

How many times Test Scenario was run?
several times

Were there any noticeable differences in Test Scenario run in cases fault was reproducible and not reproducible? 
-

[5. Test Scenario History of Execution]

Was Test Scenario passing before?
new feature
What was the last SW version Test Scenario was passing?
feature new
Were there any differences between test-lines since last time Test Scenario was passing? 
-
Were there any changes in Test Scenario since last run it passed?

Test Scenario Steps]
Cloudlab595 has been scratched with NA16.5 QL4 build - netact/product/99.16.02.0.8593. Integrating Flexi Multiradio BTS LTE to NetAct manually has been started. During Integration operations on NetAct directly Executing integration data upload error appear.
[2. Fault Description]
I right-clicked the OMS-441 object and selected Element Management → Integration Data Upload. After it, operation has been started but it was finished with status: Completed with errors. 

Fri Feb 19 14:59:56 EET 2016: Integration Data Upload triggered for : PLMN-PLMN/OMS-441
Fri Feb 19 14:59:57 EET 2016:  Configuring and restarting mediator [agent:PLMN-PLMN/OMS-441][systemId:?]
Fri Feb 19 15:00:02 EET 2016:  Configuring and restarting mediator [agent:PLMN-PLMN/OMS-441][systemId:?]
Error code: smirp.mediation.InternalMediationException
Error text: Exception occurred during upload request processing - Caused by: com.nsn.oss.mediation.common.smirp.request.SmirpRequestException: NE integration failed [dn=PLMN-PLMN/OMS-441]: Getting the session manager IOR from NE failed - Caused by: NE integration failed [dn=PLMN-PLMN/OMS-441]: Getting the session manager IOR from NE failed - Caused by: Getting the session manager IOR from NE failed - Caused by: HTTP GET failed with [HTTP/1.1 401 Authorization Required]

[3. Tester Analysis]
Integration should be finished with Completed Successfully shows in the Operation Status in the Operations History area. Error described in Fault Description - Getting the session manager IOR from NE failed- suggest that problem can be related with NWI3 interface. In NWI3 logs captured on node7 Cloudlab595 we can see like below:

2016-02-19-T15:00:01.944+0200 | clab595node07 |  | Thread-1024     | ERROR | com.nsn.oss.nwi3.topology.Nwi3NeConnection | NE activation failed [dn=PLMN-PLMN/OMS-441]: Getting the session manager IOR from NE failed

com.nsn.oss.mediation.common.smirp.request.SmirpRequestException: Exception occurred during upload request processing

The same issue has been observed also with iOMS-358 which is installed with R_GOMS7_1.8.1.0.release_oms.corr38. We can therefore conclude that the problem is not related with iOMS integration release. 
iOMS-441 has been integrated earlier with CloudLab595 (build-99.16.02.0.8511) without issues. Build on iOMS-441 was the same during both integrations - R_GOMS7_1.9.debug_oms.corr11. So suggest that problem is related with build on NetAct side. 
 
[4. Fault Repeatability]
 How many times Test Scenario was run?
 5
 How many times fault was reproduced?
 4
 Were there any noticeable differences in Test Scenario run in cases fault was reproducible and not reproducible? 
 CloudLab595 scratch installation with NetAct QL4 16.5 build 99.16.02.0.8593
 
[5. Test Scenario History of Execution]
 Was Test Scenario passing before?
 Yes
  What was the last SW version Test Scenario was passing?
  CloudLab595 build-99.16.02.0.8511
  Were there any differences between test-lines since last time Test Scenario was passing?
  No
  Were there any changes in Test Scenario since last run it passed?
  No

Copy the httpssoclient_lte shortcut to the base folder in the C:\Apps\Oss\config\EM\NOKGOMS directory.

EM start shortcut changed name between Netact versions but it is not done automatically during NetAct upgrade. In NetAct_16.2_Node_Manager_Server_Upgrade_Instructions there is entry: ""14.5 Updating Element Management Launch scripts of NOKLTE"" but it is located in Troubleshooting section. EM launch is not verified by admins during upgrade operation, so EM launch problem can't be detected by them. This information should be added to standard upgrade steps (not troubleshooting) or to troubleshooting section in OMS integration manual. I believe that some note about upgrade is also needed for ""Configuring OMS Element Manager"" step.

Also an acknowledgement is sent to the NE saying “SUCCEEDED”. But in practice this means that PM data loss in NetAct because the file content is empty for that time interval.

Expected: When /d/oss/global is full, nwi3 should not send an acknowledgement to the NE that it has successfully processed. This needs to be handled.
